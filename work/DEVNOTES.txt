Your assignment


1. Create a ListClients.js component, modeled closely after the ListAgents.js component

This component should be stored in the folder src/client

It will vary from ListAgents in the render method since the agents and clients collections have different fields

Note that the api in the src/utils folder already exists to getAll client objects from Mongo, and to delete a record as well

2. In App.js, modify the workflow so that when the menu 'Client' is selected, the component ListClients is rendered

Model the manner in which ListAgents is handled by App.js, paying close attention to the lifecycle method componentDidMount
